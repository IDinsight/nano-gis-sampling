# Nano Survey Sampling with Geographic Segmentation

[Nate: Add an introductory paragraph here of context and motivation behind the repo. This can be pulled from the blog post. Then for the last line link the blog post]

The geographic segmentation is implemented in Python as follows:
1. Put all the shapefiles on the map [Nate: can you make this more descriptive? I don't know what information is in the shapefiles or what the map is]
2. Divide the total area into smaller cells (we call them enumeration areas - EAs) [Nate: add description of how this is done, ie, what rule]
3. Determine areas with high probability of household presence [Nate: add something like "using x information"]
4. Identify EAs with non-zero probability of household presence [Nate: add something like "using x information"]
5. Create shapefiles for all objects used in plots [Nate: does "create" mean "output"? What are all the objects?]


## Getting Started

[Nate: add a sentence or two introducing what will be needed to run it, ie, installing packages, setting up the folder structure, and assembling input files]

### Installing Prerequisites

[Nate: describe what things you need to install and how to install them]

```
pip install or other package installation code goes here
```

### Directory Setup

[Nate: put the directory setup instructions here]

### Assembling Input Files

[Nate: put the input file requirements here. Talk about where somone can get their own files and any pre-processing that might be needed]

## Running the code

[Nate: explain how to run the code both via .py and for the Notebook]

```
Command(s) go here
```
